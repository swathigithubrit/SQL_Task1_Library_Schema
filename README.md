# SQL_Task1_Library_Schema
Relational database schema design for a Library Management System using SQL. Includes normalized tables, foreign key relationships, and an ER diagram. Task 1 for SQL Developer Internship.


📚 SQL Developer Internship – Task 1: Library Management System

Objective

The goal of this task is to design and implement a well-structured **relational database schema** for a Library Management System. This includes identifying entities, establishing relationships, creating normalized tables using SQL, and visualizing the schema through an ER diagram.


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- SQL (MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL)
- SQL Workbench / SQLiteStudio / pgAdmin – for schema execution
- dbdiagram.io – to visualize the ER diagram


🗃️ Database Design Overview

The database schema consists of four main entities:

1. Authors – Stores details about book authors.
2. Books – Contains book information and links to authors.
3. Members – Represents registered library members.
4. Borrow – Tracks borrowing records of books by members.

All tables follow normalization principles and are connected using primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy.

🔑 Key Concepts Applied

- ✅ Data Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- ✅ Primary and Foreign Key Constraints
- ✅ Composite Relationships
- ✅ AUTO_INCREMENT fields for unique identification
- ✅ Entity-Relationship Modeling (ERD)
- ✅ DDL commands (`CREATE TABLE`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `PRIMARY KEY`)


 📁 Files Included

- `library_schema.sql` – SQL script containing all `CREATE TABLE` statements
- `ER_Diagram.png` – Visual representation of the database schema
- `README.md` – Documentation of the task and design overview

📬 Submission

This project is submitted as Task 1 for the SQL Developer Internship assignment.
